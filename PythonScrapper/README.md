# BettingBot

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

- Fill the env variables mentionned in .env.example

- At the root of the repo:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Then launch `SportBettingBot` to launch the server

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
